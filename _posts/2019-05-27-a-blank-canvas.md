The dawn. The origin. The opening. And this, future reader, is where you have stumbled upon--the beginning.

One could say that perhaps this is not the **true** beginning, but it is a start point nevertheless. 

I have decided to begin making a blog of the things that catch my interest. Projects, observations, and 
thoughts-you will find them all here. If for no other benefit than for my own, I will write them.
